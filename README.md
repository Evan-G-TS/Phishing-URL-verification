**Overview**
This project demonstrates a machine learning-based system for detecting phishing URLs. It combines data science with cybersecurity awareness, to showcase how malicious URLs can be identified through intelligent feature extraction and classification models.

**Goals**
Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering on URLs

Train and evaluate ML models to classify phishing URLs


**Machine Learning Pipeline**
Data Collection

Public phishing URL datasets (e.g., PhishTank, Kaggle)

Feature Engineering

URL length

Presence of HTTPS

Suspicious keywords (e.g., "login", "secure", "bank")

Special characters and domain patterns

Model Training

Train multiple classifiers

Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall

Prediction

Real-time classification via Flask app

Feature vector aligned with training schema
